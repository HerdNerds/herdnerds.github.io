Multi-digit 7-segment displays typically have two or more digits, each of which consists of a 7-segment display by itself. The common lines of each individual digit are used to select the digit to be lit. The driver program uses a technique called "multiplexing", i.e. lighting one digit at a time very rapidly to display all the digits.

##Typical Pin Out##
The figure below shows the typical pin-out (i.e. the layout of pins) on a typical 4-digit display. Notice the pins labeled "DIG1" through "DIG4" that are used to activate each digit. Also notice that there is no common LOW (for a common cathode display) or a common HIGH (for a common anode display), unlike that of a single-digit display.

##Schematic##
The schematic (also called "circuit schematic" or "circuit diagram") shows how a typical 4-digit display is hooked up to an Arduino. Please note that in schematics, the way the pins are represented does NOT necessarily match the pinout of the device.
